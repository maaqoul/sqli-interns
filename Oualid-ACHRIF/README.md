# CSS Grid Generator:

## What I Did:

I built the HTML structure to define the grid container and user interface elements.
I implemented CSS styles to create a visually appealing grid layout with responsiveness.
I utilized JavaScript to provide functionality for defining the number of rows and columns, generating the CSS code, and selecting div elements

## What I Learned:

I gained a deeper understanding of CSS Grid properties such as grid-template-columns, grid-template-rows, grid-gap, and grid-area.
I developed my JavaScript skills in DOM manipulation and event handling to select div elements within the main container and manipulate strings to generate dynamic CSS code.
I also explored principles of user interface design.

## Challenges Faced:

Designing an intuitive and aesthetically pleasing user interface was another challenge.
Calculating the index of the div within the main container (row start and end index) and selecting it with the mouse proved to be very difficult. I had to search extensively to find a solution.

# SVG

## what i did

I created the sky and the sun, setting their colors, and then added the moon and a button to switch between day and night. I utilized JavaScript to change the sky color from day to night and make the moon visible. Additionally, I included mountains, ground, and a lake, which can also transition between day and night. I also added clouds and trees, which are visible during the day, and stars that appear when the time changes to night.

## what i learned 

I learned how to code using SVG tags and developed my design skills by adding details that were not explicitly requested in the exercise, such as the clouds and their animation. I also learned the purpose of various SVG tags.

## Challenges Faced

I encountered a challenge when it came to combining shapes to create the mountains, ground, and lake, as there were no specific tags available for these elements. As a workaround, I used circles to represent clouds and trees and combined rectangles and triangles to create the horizon view.
