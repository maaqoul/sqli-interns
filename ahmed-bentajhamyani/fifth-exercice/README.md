# CSS Grid Generator

## Overview

This web application allows users to generate CSS grid code based on the divs selected in the grid.

App : https://ahmed-bentajhamyani.github.io/css-grid-generator/

## Features

- **Grid Generation**: The application dynamically generates a grid of div elements based on user input for the number of rows and columns and the size of the columns and rows gap in px.
- **Drag and Drop Selection**: Users can select multiple divs by clicking and dragging the mouse cursor across the grid.
- **Color Customization**: Selected divs can be colored using a random color generated by the application.
- **HTML & CSS Code Display**: The application displays the generated HTML & CSS code, allowing users to see the HTML elements and the CSS properties applied to the selected divs.

## What I Learned

Through this project, I learned:

- **CSS Grid**: How to create and customize CSS grids to create flexible and responsive layouts.
- **Event Handling**: How to handle mouse events in JavaScript to implement drag and drop selection functionality.
- **DOM Manipulation**: How to dynamically create, modify, and remove HTML elements using JavaScript to update the grid layout and display CSS code.

## Challenges

- **Drag and Drop Selection**: Implementing the drag and drop selection functionality posed a challenge, particularly in finding the divs that should be selected between the mouse down and the mouse up events.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensuring that the application is responsive and works well on different devices and screen sizes required careful consideration and testing of layout and styling.
