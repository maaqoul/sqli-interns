- This project allows you to set numbers for columns and rows, and it will generate a CSS grid for you with its matching css and html code.

- While working on this generator I learned some new features about event listeners that I encountered by accident and didn't even need to use it afterall, it forced me to improve my coding structure (I'm still trying to improve it) and it helped me improve my DOM navigating skills.

- I was faced with some challenges too such as : my lack of knowledge for some properties and css selectors.

- here is a [demo](css-grid-generator.vercel.app/)
