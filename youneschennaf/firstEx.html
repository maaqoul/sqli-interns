    <h1>Welcome to my page</h1>
    <h2>Meta charset</h2>
    <p>the meta charset specifies which unicode to use in the page, the utf-8 let us use multiple characters including special characters and from other languages</p>
    <h2>Meta viewport</h2>
    <p>the meta viewport tells the browser which viewport to use and which scale so that even with different width it will always take the whole width</p>
