                <h1>Introduction</h1>
                <p>When I started my journey in computer science, I often heard the terms frontend and backend, and
                    honestly they confused me quite a bit. So that's why I am writing this article to relieve the minds
                    of my fellow code enthusiasts from the hassle of figuring it out by themselves. Frontend and backend
                    are two related subjects but at the same time they are separated entities. So let's view each one of
                    them separately.</p>

                <h1>Frontend</h1>
                <p>Front-end refers to the client-side of a software application or website, which is the part that
                    users interact with directly. It encompasses everything users experience visually and interactively
                    in their web browsers or other applications. Front-end development involves creating and
                    implementing the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) components of a website or
                    application.</p>
                <p>Key aspects of front-end development include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language):</strong> Defines the structure and content of web
                            pages.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):</strong> Controls the presentation and styling of HTML
                            elements, determining how the content is displayed on the screen.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>JavaScript:</strong> A programming language that adds interactivity, dynamic
                            behavior, and manipulation of the DOM (Document Object Model) to web pages. It allows for
                            the creation of responsive and dynamic user interfaces.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Front-end developers work to ensure that websites and applications are visually appealing,
                    responsive, and provide a seamless user experience. They collaborate closely with back-end
                    developers, who manage server-side functionality, databases, and application logic, to create fully
                    functional and integrated software systems.</p>
                <p>In addition to the core technologies mentioned above, front-end development often involves the use of
                    various frameworks, libraries, and tools to streamline the development process and enhance the user
                    interface. Popular front-end frameworks include React.js, Angular, and Vue.js, while libraries like
                    jQuery provide additional functionality to simplify JavaScript development.</p>

                <h1>Backend</h1>
                <p>
                    Backend, or server-side development, refers to the behind-the-scenes work that powers the
                    functionality and data management of a software application or website. Unlike the front-end, which
                    focuses on user interface and interaction, the backend deals with server logic, databases, and the
                    overall functionality that enables the frontend to operate. Backend development is responsible for
                    handling data storage, processing, and the communication between the server and the client.</p>
                <p>Key components and concepts in backend development include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Server:</strong> The server is the computer or system that hosts and runs the backend
                        code. It responds to requests from clients (typically browsers) and manages the application's
                        business logic.</li>
                    <li><strong>Databases:</strong> Backend development involves working with databases to store,
                        retrieve, and manage data. Common types of databases include SQL databases (e.g., MySQL,
                        PostgreSQL) and NoSQL databases (e.g., MongoDB).</li>
                    <li><strong>Server-Side Programming Languages:</strong> Backend developers use programming languages
                        to write the logic that runs on the server. Common languages include Python, Ruby, Java, PHP,
                        Node.js (JavaScript), and others.</li>
                    <li><strong>APIs (Application Programming Interfaces):</strong> APIs allow different software
                        components to communicate with each other. In a web development context, APIs often enable
                        communication between the frontend and backend or between different backend services.</li>
                    <li><strong>Frameworks:</strong> Backend frameworks provide pre-built modules, tools, and structures
                        to streamline development. Examples include Django and Flask for Python, Ruby on Rails for Ruby,
                        Spring for Java, and Express.js for Node.js.</li>
                    <li><strong>Authentication and Authorization:</strong> Backend development is responsible for
                        implementing secure user authentication and authorization mechanisms to control access to data
                        and functionality.</li>
                    <li><strong>Security:</strong> Ensuring the security of the application by implementing measures
                        such as data encryption, input validation, and protection against common web vulnerabilities.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Backend developers work hand-in-hand with front-end developers to create a fully functional, secure,
                    and efficient software application. Together, the frontend and backend components form a complete
                    and cohesive system that provides a seamless user experience.
