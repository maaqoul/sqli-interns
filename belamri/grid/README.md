# Grid-Generator
A powerful tool that will generate code for your CSS grid layouts, created during my first week internship at SQLI company under the supervision of Mr.Hicham Maaqoul.

## How it works:
We basically have a container that will originally be empty, its display will be set to grid, this is where the user will be able to select areas for each element, we then generate divs according to user input, which is the number of rows multiplied by the number of columns, we set mouse down and mouse up event listeners on each one of these divs, so that we can use to detect how much area the user has selected for each div and draw them with a random color and save the necessary data that will later be used to generate our code.
## What i aquired:
CSS Grid proficiency, i learned new properties i didnt know about before, i feel more comfortable manipulating grid dimensions now, i also got a deeper knowledge on how to dynamically manipulate the DOM using Javascript based on user input.
## Challenges:
I had a hard time choosing the right HTML tags/semantics for my code, i will need to practice more on this.
