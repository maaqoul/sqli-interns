The CSS Grid Generator is a tool that allows users to create custom CSS grid layouts easily. Users can specify the number of columns, rows, column gap, and row gap, and the tool generates the corresponding CSS code for the grid layout.




Working on this project presented several challenges and opportunities for growth. Here are some of the key lessons I learned:

 Developing a CSS grid generator from scratch required learning new concepts and technologies within a limited timeframe. This experience enhanced my ability to quickly grasp unfamiliar concepts and apply them effectively in a project.

 Overcoming challenges during the development process often involved searching for solutions and resources online. This project significantly improved my ability to search for and evaluate relevant information.

Importance of Planning Before diving into coding, I realized the importance of thoughtful architecture and planning.
